# VisLabStats
Website to visualize the daily visitation statistics for the Visual World Investigate Lab. Updated from an earlier project to focus on half day statistics. 

Project is inspired by the work of Walt Gurley (https://github.com/WaltGurley/DailyStats) and the Calendar View from D3 (https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318). These updates focus only on the Visual World with new visualizations to capture the morning and afternoon measurements.
